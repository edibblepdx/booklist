## Fully Read
- :star: __Programming in Lua, Fourth Edition__; _Roberto Ierusalimschy_
  > Lua, my G.O.A.T. The exercises in this book are really good.
- :star: __Introduction to Linear Algebra, Sixth Edition__; _Gilbert Strang_
  > I had the opportunity to teach a linear algebra class once for a single day, and it was fun.
  > The chapters are short so it's really easy to take one or two passes then solidify everything you learned with the great exercises that follow.
- :star: __Longman Student Grammar of Spoken and Written English__; _Douglas Biber, Susan Conrad, Geoffrey Leech_
  > I have an insane number of sticky notes in this book. It's comical even. Great book for a linguist interested in the English language.

  > Part of the "Very Short Introductions" series (148 pages). I bought this from a chic bookstore while reading Houseki no Kuni.
  > In it, Damien Keown explores the creation and evolution of Buddhism, its variations, central teachings, and its dissemination throughout Asia and the West.
