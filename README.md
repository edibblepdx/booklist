An incomplete list of learning resource books that I have fully or partially read.
> :star: means that I highly recommend this book.

## Fully Read
- :star: __Programming in Lua, Fourth Edition__; _Roberto Ierusalimschy_
  > Lua, my G.O.A.T. The exercises in this book are really good.
- :star: __The Rust Programming Language__; _Steve Klabnik, Carol Nichols, Chris Krycho, with contributions from the Rust Community_
  > Including rustlings and the brown book.
- :star: __Introduction to Linear Algebra, Sixth Edition__; _Gilbert Strang_
  > I had the opportunity to teach a linear algebra class once for a single day, and it was fun.
  > The chapters are short so it's really easy to take one or two passes then solidify everything you learned with the great exercises that follow.
- :star: __Longman Student Grammar of Spoken and Written English__; _Douglas Biber, Susan Conrad, Geoffrey Leech_
  > I have an insane number of sticky notes in this book. It's comical even. Great book for a linguist interested in the English language.
- :star: __Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction, First Edition__; _Damien Keown_
  > Part of the "Very Short Introductions" series (148 pages). I bought this from a chic bookstore while reading Houseki no Kuni.

  > There exists a new and updated second edition.
- :star: __Confucianism: A Very Short Introduction__; _Daniel K. Gardner_
  > Part of the "Very Short Introductions" series (124 pages). I bought this while reading Kingdom, where the comparison of
  > Legalism and Confucianism is an existing theme. In it, Daniel K. Gardner explores classical Confucianism, Mencius and Xunzi schools of Confuciansim,
  > and Neo Confucianism, ending with Confucianism in practice leading into the 20th and 21st centuries.
- __Introduction to Mathematical Analysis I__; _B. Lafferiere, G. Lafferiere, Nguyen Mau Nam_
  > G. Lafferiere and Nguyen Mau Nam were two of my professors whom I deeply respect.
- __The Book of Shaders__; _Patricio Gonzalez Vivo, Jen Lowe_
  > This book is incomplete.
- __HTML and CSS__; _Jon Duckett_
  > MDN Web Docs tends to be a better reference, but this book can provide helpful visuals, although a bit dated.
- __Engineering Software Products__; _Ian Sommerville_
  > Introduction to different software architectures and Agile methodologies.

## Partially Read
- :star: __Physically Based Rendering: From Theory to Implementation, Fourth Edition__; _Matt Pharr, Wenzel Jakob, Greg Humphreys_
- :star: __Deep Learning__; _Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville_
- :star: __Riichi Book I__; _Daina Chiba_
  > Riichi Mahjong Strategy Guide.
- :star: __The Go Programming Language__; _Alan A. A. Donovan, Brian W. Kernighan_
  > A little dated and does not include items like generics, but otherwise a quality book in its depth with good exercises.
  > A good supplement for the missing material would be "Go by Example", by Mark McGranaghan and Eli Bendersky.
- :star: __Programming in Haskell, Second Edition__; _Graham Hutton_
- :star: __Ray Tracing in One Weekend Series__; _Peter Shirley, Trevor David Black, Steve Hollasch_
- __The C Programming Language__; _Brian Kernighan, Dennis Ritchie_
